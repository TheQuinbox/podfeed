# Podfeed.

Simple CLI tool to get the feed URL from Apple Podcast links.

## Why?

Many podcatchers don't support Apple Podcasts out-of-the-box. This makes listening to them in anything that's not iTunes or the web extremely annoying. As such, this tool was born. It grabs the feed URL from any Apple Podcasts link, and prints it. You can then put this link into your favorite podcatcher, and listen away.
